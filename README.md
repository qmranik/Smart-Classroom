# Smart-Classroom

Smart Classroom is an Android Application which connects student’s devices with teacher’s one using Wi-Fi Direct API and transfers voice to the last and corner row’s students who are quite far from teacher and having trouble listening and understanding lectures. It was implemented by Java programming language. 
The application performs delivering data, recording, drawing and can use any existing Bluetooth speaker at any conference or assembly. 

Here the main idea is to use the Teacher's phone as a transmitter which will transmit the Audio data and Students phone will receive the Audio data and Output it using there Phone's speaker. If there is any existing bluetooth speaker then transmit the data to that speaker and the bluetooth speaker will output the Audio.

 In this connection tab students device can connect with teacher’s device. To connect they have to turn on wifi and location as WiFi-Direct API requires those to establish connection. After that, they have to press discover button so that they can find teacher’s device and send request to connect. After accepting the connection request by the Teacher(host). The connection is established now they have to press start button Then the lecture (Audio data) will broadcast to all connected devices and all connected devices will receive the audio stream and output the data using phone's speaker which was broadcasted from teacher’s device.
